In this project I made a website about myself, although not amazing it has the basis to get much better.
This website is made out of 4 main pages:
Home
LifeJourney
Achievements
Contact

Each of these pages have their own HTML file attached to them but they all are linked together through the ribbon at the top of the page.

There is one CSS file which runs all the general codes for the classes that construct every page.
There are more than 5 CSS properties and selectors being utilized, and there is one single #id being used in every page.

There are a lot of class selector implemented in the code as well.

This all can be checked on the CSS file.

A @media section is being utilized twice.

Pretty much everything should be covered in the pages that are being submitted.
Everything that you can see that looks like its clickable it probably is. Just mess around with the webpages and you will see!
